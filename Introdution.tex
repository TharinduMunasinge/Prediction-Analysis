\section{Introdution}

Cloud computing has already gained ground with advantages like scalability, high availability and on-demand resource provisioning. According to the NIST definition \cite{Mell_2011}, cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing resources, such as networks, servers, storage, applications and platforms, over the network based on user demand. Based on the definition, it is evident that elasticity is a major requirement of any cloud platform, which is often achieved via an auto scaling process. Auto scaling refers to the dynamic allocation and deallocation of resources for a cloud application, in order to optimize its resource utilization while minimizing the cost as well as achieving the desired Quality of Service (QoS) and availability goals.\cite{Roy_2011}\cite{Armbrust_2010}.

Autoscaling can be achieved via reactive as well as proactive approaches. In reactive, threshold based auto-scaling, users have to specify thresholds for workload metrics, and scaling would occur only after such thresholds are exceeded\cite{Lorido_Botran_2014}. In this approach, even though it is desirable to maintain high thresholds which would result in higher levels of resource utilization, thresholds should be sufficiently small to compensate for delays in formulating and executing scaling action. Although this seems to be the most customizable approach from the userâ€™s perspective, it has several weaknesses \cite{Alipour:2014:AAI:2735522.2735532} such as the inability to adapt to workload patterns (e.g., thrashing during load fluctuations), low resource utilization and higher cost under smaller thresholds, and the risk of service degradation under larger thresholds and rapidly increasing workloads. Coming up with an optimum threshold in a reactive auto scaling system is nontrivial and it requires prior user expertise (e.g., of traffic patterns and IaaS/PaaS parameters like pricing models and packages) for composing effective thresholds that can carry out scaling efficiently.

In the proactive approach, resource requirements for the future time horizon are forecast based on the demand history. With accurate predictions, an application can take early scaling decisions so that when the workload reach a particular level, the required resources will already have been allocated. As a result, resource utilization can be safely increased to a maximum level. However, the reliability of such an approach depends mainly on the accuracy of the predicted values. Since we forecast the future workload requirement (e.g., memory consumption, CPU utilization, network request count) from historical data of the same measure, time series forecasting methods can be used under this approach.

We have identified several challenges specific to workload prediction for auto scaling.
\begin{itemize}
\item PaaS system can have different applications with different workload patterns, so that the workload prediction model should not be over fitted to a specific workload pattern.
\item Workload data set continuously grow with time so that the predictive model should be evolved and continuously learn the workload characteristic. 
\item Workload predictor should be able to give results within a bounded time period.
\item Give that the  time horizon for the prediction should be chosen based on the physical constraints like VM uptime and gracefully shutting down time, predictor should be able to give sufficiently accurate results in longer horizon.
\end{itemize}

The objective of this work is to come up with a prediction method that can be trained real-time in each iteration to capture the latest trends and provides sufficiently accurate results over drastically different workload patterns. First we evaluated the ability of individual models to give accurate answers in real-time predictions on evolving dataset. In that experiment we tested time series forecasting methods including both statistical methods like ARIMA and Exponential Model, machine learning models like neural network and a prediction method used in Apache Stratos an open source Platform as a service framework. Then we have implemented our proposed ensemble technique combining the results from neural network, ARIMA and exponential model, and tested on three publicly available datasets, two real-world cloud workload dataset and Google cluster dataset. According to the experimental results our proposed solution outperform each individual methods, and two other ensemble techniques.

Rest of the paper structured follows: Section 2 existing works on cloud workload prediction techniques and there limitations.Section 3 describes and evaluates the existing time series techniques for forecasting to explore the ability of provide  accurate predictions on publicly available datasets with predictable patterns under a real-time training scenario. Section 4 introduces and explains our ensemble technique and  the predcition algorithm. Section 5 , presents the results of the tests performed. Section 6 presents concluding remarks.
