\section{Limitations of the existing research works}

 These research works were primarily based on specific datasets. So that the resulted predictive model might not be a good fit for an application with different workload characteristics. In some of the solutions the predictive model was found using offline training on datasets so that the dynamic adaptation for the current workload changes is not there. 
In mathematically some time series prediction techniques like exponential moving average and ARIMA has some preconditions to be fitted well with the dataset. Itâ€™s quite unlikely that all the applications will met these preconditions. Even in a single prediction technique, there are parameters to be adjusted to fit with specific data set. So identifying optimum parameters for the model should be happend dynamic online training process rather than having constants defined in offline training process.
