\subsection{Error Measures}
For quantitative analysis, we used the following two error measures:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Root Mean Squared Errors (RMSEs)} are of the same scale as the data. As it is scale dependent, it cannot be used to make comparisons between series that are of different scales \cite{Forecasting_OTexts}. RMSE can be represented as follows:
$$RMSE=\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{t=1}^{n}(\hat{x}_{t}-x_{t})^{2}}{n}}$$

where $x_{t}$ is the real value at time $t$,  $\hat{x}_{t}$ is the forecast value at time $t$ and $n$ is the number of data points in dataset.

\item \textit{Percentage errors} have the advantage of being scale-independent, but they overemphasize the errors for values that are actually small. Percentage errors can be represented as follows:
$$MAPE=\frac{100}{n}\sum_{t=1}^{n}\left | \frac{\hat{x}_{t}-x_{t}}{x_{t}} \right |$$
where $x_{t}$ is the real value at time $t$,  $\hat{x}_{t}$ is the forecast value at time $t$ and $n$ is the number of data points in dataset.

\end{itemize}
