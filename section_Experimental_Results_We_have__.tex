\section{Experimental Results}

We have implemented the prediction algorithm in R using the time series and machine learning model implementations in forecast package. We used the publicly available datasets mentioned in <<SECTION 1>> and also we have tested on several real world cloud workload datasets [GITHUB LINK FOR DATASET] collected from server applications.
