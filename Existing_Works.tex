\section{Existing Works}

There is a significant amount of already established research work in the workload prediction domain. Exponential smoothing is popularly used for predicting purposes. Mi et al. [18] also used a quadratic exponential smoothing against real workload traces (World Cup 98), and showed good accurate results, with a small amount of error. The auto-regression method has been widely used in the literature ([19], [20], [21]). Kupferman et al. [19] applied autoregression of single order to predict request rate and found that its performance depends largely on several user-defined parameters: the size of the input window and the size of the horizon window.Auto-regressive moving average method (ARMA) is the dominant time series analysis technique for workload and resource usage prediction. Roy et al. [4] use a second order ARMA for workload prediction on the World Cup 98 traces and showed good accurate results. Machine learning techniques like neural networks and regression have been applied by several authors but those techniques are not widely used as time series methods. There were researches on using history window values as the input for a neural network [22] and a multiple linear regression equation [19], [22]. The accuracy of both methods depends on the input window size.
