\section{Workload prediction}

As described in the <<FIRST>> chapter, to avoid the drawbacks of threshold based reactive systems a proactive scaling algorithm should be run on top of the predicted future workload values. our proactive scaling solution has 3 major components

\begin{itemize}
\item Workload Predictor - Predicting the workload for future time horizon
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Scaling decision maker- Calculating the number of virtual machines required to handle the predicted workload while minimizing the cost of the scaling action.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Cost optimizer - Performing further cost optimizations like smart killing
\end{itemize}
