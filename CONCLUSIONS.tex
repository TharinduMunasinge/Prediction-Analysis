\section{Conclusios and Future Works}


Combining forecasts from conceptually different models effectively reduces the prediction errors and hence provides
considerably increased accuracy. Over the years, many linear forecasts combination techniques have been developed in literature. Although these are simple to understand and implement but often criticized due to their ignorance of the relationships among contributing forecasts. Literature on nonlinear forecast combination is very limited and so there is a need of more extensive works on this area. In this paper, we propose a robust weighted nonlinear
technique for combining multiple time series models. The proposed method considers individual forecasts as well as the correlations between forecast pairs for creating the ensemble. A rigorous algorithm is suggested to determine the appropriate combination weights. The proposed ensemble is constructed with three well-known forecasting models and is tested on three real world time series, two stationary and one seasonal. Empirical findings demonstrate that the proposed technique outperforms each individual model as well as three other popular linear combination techniques, in terms of obtained forecast accuracies. It is to be noted that the proposed mechanism is highly efficient when the contributing forecasts are strongly correlated. In future, the effectiveness of the suggested method can be further explored, especially for non stationary and chaotic time series datasets.
